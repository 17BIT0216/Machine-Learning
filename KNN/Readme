We are given an Unlabled Data and had to decide the Target class of the upcoming data. As the Data was Unlabeled, I decided to go with KNN(1) and got some accuracy and precision values that were low.So again to increase the accuracy i played around with the k values using an elbow method(basically using a lot of k values and taking the one with least error rate) and observed that the accuracy was the highest at the val 20 after plotting the error rate,and again retrained my data with that K value.
I had to standarize the values to because they were far apart, so that the we don't get any type of bias.
