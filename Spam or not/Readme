So, we have a data set of messages and using this data sets we have to decide whether a message is spam or not.
The first roadblock is we dont have any numeric data to feed to the ML alogorithms so what we do is use NLP to convert the 
text to some meaningful vector we do that by using CountVectorizer which converts the text into a multi dimensional vector.
But, before that we have to preprocess our data--> remove punctuations and most commonly occuring word, then transfom it using
a CountVectorizer. But this Data does not have any relation so we use a TF-idf to find a relation between the data and
then use MultiNomialNB to predict the result.

We reach an accuracy of 96%
