Finance Data Project
In this data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. Keep in mind, this project is just meant to practice your visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.

We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.
